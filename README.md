# Cirkl
Cirkl is a desktop IoT device built on [LilyGO's ESP32 T-RGB board](https://www.lilygo.cc/products/t-rgb). 
It's purpose to provide a means of connection between its users, as well as to act as a useful time/weather station.

At its current stage, only the firmware of the device is being developed. 
In the future however, a web app with a Google Firebase backend will be built which Cirkl can communicate with.
This will allow Cirkl to complete its purpose of photo sharing. 

# For Example:
- Two users have their own cirkl devices which are connected to the internet.
- User A visits the web app and uploads a photo from their phone/computer. 
- User B's Cirkl pings, showing a notification that it received a new message. User B can now view the image sent to their device.

This allows for personalized photos and messages to be sent to a Cirkl owner.

# But Why?
Yes, text message exists.
### Cirkl is meant to be more "meaningful" than that.
- Text message has become so mainstream that it doesn't replicate the "feel" of an oldschool letter or an in-person heartfelt message.
- Cirkl aims to provide the feeling you get from opening a sentimental letter in a 21st century form factor.

# Features Cirkl will implement:
- Internet time and weather
- Support sharing photos, text, and drawings
- "Gallery" mode - flip through x amount of most recent messages
- Sync on-device reminders with Google calendar
- Settings app to modify device color scheme and other configurations
- SD Card support (offline message storage, device settings, etc)
- App extensibility (for future feature additions)
