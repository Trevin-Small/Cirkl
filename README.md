# Cirkl
Cirkl is a desktop IoT device built on [LilyGO's ESP32 T-RGB board](https://www.lilygo.cc/products/t-rgb).

# What is it?
Cirkl is a device that allows you to view photos that others have sent you.
It's rather charming to receive a nostalgic picture with your friend, a drawing from your child, or a memory from a spouse.
### So Why not put these meaningful messages on display?
Cirkl's main feature, its gallery function, loops through a slideshow of all the meaningful messages that others have sent to your device.
This allows you to view great memories throughout your day in a non-intrusive manner!
- Further, Cirkl also displays the time and weather for convenient reference at any time. Brilliant!

# How does it work?
Anytime that someone sends you a photo through the web app, your Cirkl device automatically receives the message and updates its slideshow accordingly!

At this time, the firmware of the device and the accompanying website are still under construction.

# For Example:
- Two users have their own Cirkl devices which are connected to the internet.
- User A visits the web app and uploads a photo from their phone/computer.
- User B's Cirkl pings, displaying a notification that it received a new message. User B can now view the image sent to their device.
- The same process can happen in reverse with user B sending a message to user A's Cirkl.
